This directory contains software for solving bin-packing and
covering puzzles, using the dancing-links method of Knuth (see
paper in this directory).

The files ending in .puz are shell scripts that generate all the
orientations for pieces associated with several puzzles.

   cage.puz - a 12 piece puzzle that must be inserted into a cage.
              Difficult.  Two solutions, one cannot be assembled.
   2cb1.puz - a 2 cube puzzle by D. Closterman.  11 pieces that
              may be placed in a 2 x 4 x 7 box with two cubes left
              filled by the box.
   2cb1a.puz - the above 2 cube puzzle pieces placed in a 3x3x3 cube.
               two of these cubes may be constructed at the same
               time, using the 11 pieces above.

flatten.  Takes a multi-dimensional input and flattens it into a single
line for use in the cover problems.  A shift to each higher dimension
is signaled by a carriage return.

reshape.  Reverses the effect of flatten.

tumble.  Tumbles a piece into all of its orientations, and prints a
list of unique orientations.  Inefficient, currently, but works.

cover.  Takes a file of lines and prints out a single line that is
completely and exactly covered by some subset.  Hitting ^\ will give
status reports.  Using +s will turn on a heuristic that will focus
the search on the part of the search space with least branching.  Knuth
thinks this may be faster at solving large problems, but may slow down
the solution to small ones.

cover2 - a start on a version that implements cover operations using
bits.
